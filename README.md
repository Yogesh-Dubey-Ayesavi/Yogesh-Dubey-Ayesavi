# Hello, I'm Yogesh! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with experience in Flutter, XMPP, and ML. I have also worked with Node.js, AWS, Firebase, and AWS Amplify. I am passionate about building innovative and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

## Technologies and Skills

- **Flutter**: I have extensive experience in building cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter framework, including UI/UX design, state management, and integration with RESTful APIs.
- **XMPP**: I am currently learning XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), a widely used communication protocol for real-time messaging, and exploring its potential for building chat applications.
- **Node.js**: I have worked with Node.js for server-side development, building RESTful APIs, implementing authentication and authorization, and deploying applications on AWS.
- **AWS**: I have experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS), including services such as AWS Lambda, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, AWS Cognito, and AWS Amplify, for building scalable and cloud-based applications.
- **Firebase**: I have worked with Firebase, a cloud-based mobile and web application development platform, for building real-time databases, authentication, cloud messaging, and hosting applications.
